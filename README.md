# POtOS
A *SUPER* simple 16-bit OS I wrote in x86 assembly (with stealing a lot of code from MikeOS)

## How to build
Step 1: Use Linux

Step 2: Install deez dependencies (build-essential / qemu / nasm) (qemu isn't actually needed, unless you want to run the OS)

Step 3: Run build.sh as root

Step 4: ???

Step 5: Profit
